# Landing Page (Boostrap 5 & Webpack) - Data with Analytics

Coding a template in Boostrap 5 using Webpack. Project by Rahul Rao available at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/990634575416780811).

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
```

The `dev` command will start a dev server and watch for code changes in JS and SCSS files. Hot reloading is enabled, so that any change will be visible in your browser as you type.

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production usage, run the `build` command and everything packed together into the `public` directory.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Environment Configuration

The `.env.sample` file should contain all the variables that your application needs.

## TO DO!

-   [x] Adaptation of navbar-toggler to the page (the project didn't include these elements)

-   [x] Replacement of partner logos
-   [x] Animate on scroll
-   [x] Adding swiper for testimonial
-   [x] Adding lazyload
-   [x] Improving the responsive version of the website
